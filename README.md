# Credit-Approval-Classifier
To run the code, run the Neural Network.ipynb file. This assignment was completed as a part of the course BITS F312 Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic under the supervision of Prof. Surekha Bhanot.
The aim of the assignment is to build the structure for a neural network from ground up in Python using the numpy library. The neural network is then custom modelled and run on the credit approval dataset.
