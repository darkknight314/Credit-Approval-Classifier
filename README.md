# Credit-Approval-Classifier
To run the code, run the Classifier.ipynb file. This assignment was completed as a part of the course BITS F312 Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic under the supervision of Prof. Surekha Bhanot.
The aim of the assignment is to build the structure for a neural network from ground up in Python using the NumPy library. Various activation functions such as ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, ELU etc, their gradient functions, forward propagation as well backward propogation were implemented. Then they were used together to implement a neural network. The neural network was custom modelled and run on the credit approval dataset. The final architecture consisted of 4 neurons in the hidden layer with tanh activation and output neuron with sigmoid activation. It achieved a train accuracy of 79% and test accuracy of 88%.
